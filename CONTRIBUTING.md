<!-- ## üß© Plugin Contributions

Want to build your own AI skill or capability?

   horcrux plugin create my-skill

Then test it:

   horcrux plugin test ./my-skill

Each plugin should include:
- A `plugin.yaml` manifest
- A `README.md`
- Optional `config.schema.json` if it supports UI
- Tests or usage examples

Submit a PR to `horcrux-plugins` and the core team will review and onboard it!

--- -->

## üõ† Code Guidelines

- Follow modular boundaries and plugin specs
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Format code (e.g., `prettier`, `black`)
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive
- Use `.env.example` to document configs

---

<!-- ## üß™ Local Development

You can run Horcrux services via Docker:

   docker-compose up

Or launch specific plugins/tools using:

   horcrux plugin run ./plugins/my-skill

Each service repo may include `README.md` with runtime or build instructions.
